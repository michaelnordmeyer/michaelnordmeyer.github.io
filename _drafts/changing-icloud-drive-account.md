## iBooks

All highlights and notes are stored in iCloud and not in the books itself. Changing your account means losing all highlights and notes.

It’s possible to send all highlights and notes via email but it’s buggy. Depending on the amount of consecutive highlighted lines or paragraphs, this will only send a subset without telling you. You may be able to work around it if you only select a smaller number of lines and create separate highlights. A very inconvenient “solution”. I experienced problems on an iPad when selecting more than a third of a page. The problem exists at least in iOS 7 and 8.
