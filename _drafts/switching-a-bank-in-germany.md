Harder than you think, unfortunately.

It’s much easier to switch bank accounts today than it was ten years ago. The main task is to inform all contractual partners to charge a different bank account.

In Germany if people have a contract and a recurring payment with a company, say for an insurance or the rent, bank accounts are commonly charged automatically. In fact you won't get some contracts like post-paid mobile phone plans or even a lease on an apartment without agreeing to have your bank account automatically charged. But that’s not an issue because almost all people can get a bank account and this convenience feature is free.

Direct debit makes life so much easier. To not have to worry about when or how much to pay. No angry letters or canceled contracts because of missed payments. That is one of the reasons credit cards are not as common in Germany as there is not much for them. The other is most bank account come with a debit card, which can be used like a credit card in stores and at ATMs. This applies to most of Europe as well.

But it’s somewhat of an effort to tell all your contractual partners that your bank account has been changed. Some people don’t even know which companies need to be informed because they don’t keep track of this kind of information or don’t budget.

Many companies have websites where you can manage your accounts by yourself. For example insurance companies, power or water providers, telecommunication providers. And of course Internet companies like Amazon.

IBAN (International Bank Account Number)

Have they heard about copy & paste? Apparently not.

Separating the first two letters, then limiting the length so the last two digits get dropped

Not removing space from the IBAN

Needing the BIC (Swift code)

Not allowing to create a new one to replace the old. You have to change the old one, which isn't obvious. After erroneously creating the new one, the old on cannot be deleted without a proper indication why. Changing the old one doesn’t work because you already use the new account data for the newly creating one. So you have to delete the new one first and then change the old one. A proper workflow would have helped.

But most people, especially software developers, have a hard time creating software which really is helpful. They think _you_ have to work the software.

The process of changing all those accounts isn't hard. But because of my many Internet accounts it took a couple of hours. No wonder nobody wants to switch banks. Some use only Paypal to not expose credit cards or to only have to change it in one place.
