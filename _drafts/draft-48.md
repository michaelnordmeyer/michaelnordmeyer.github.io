Because most people think of the iPad Pro as a notebook replacement, I want to compare three ultra-light devices to show that it’s not easy to replace: the 12″ MacBook Retina, the iPad Pro 12.9″ and 9.7″, and the iPad Air 2. I use external keyboards for both iPads, because having one means I'm much more productive, even though I quite like the on-screen keyboard. I don't write about the Apple Pencil and the obvious benefits for artistic use cases, because the MacBook as a notebook can't act as a drawing board. So if you think about getting the iPad Pro because of the Apple Pencil, well, there’s no other option than to just get the iPad Pro.

## The iPad Pro 12.9" – A Humongous Tablet

While it’s true the iPad Pro has a larger screen, in my opinion this larger screen is only helpful if running two apps side by side. But because of the size you can't call the iPad Pro a tablet anymore. It’s so huge I rather want to put it down on a table. It feels more like a notebook than a tablet. The screen is exactly twice the size of a normal non-mini iPad. You can put two iPads next to each other and you get about the size of an iPad Pro.

## The iPad Air 2 – A True Tablet

The iPad Air 2 feels like a true tablet, which you can easily hold and operate with single hand. When standing two hands are more convenient. Two apps side by side feel cramped. One app feels just right.

### Keyboard – Virtual and Physical

The on-screen keyboard is okay for me. I can type on it at fast speed using four to six fingers. The only downer is the large amount of screen space the keyboard uses: 50 %. This doesn't leave much space for the actual text I'm writing. The external keyboard is fine. It’s not full size, but it has all the keys a normal keyboard has like number keys and a couple of other keys which are not directly accessible on the virtual keyboard without switching. I work faster on it than on the on-screen keyboard, especially if I need to edit the text. The cursor keys and the word navigation is quite convenient. Especially the custom keys for task switching, home and search make me much more productive.

## Comparison of Technical Data

All measurements done with European duckheads. For the cellular versions add 150 € for the iPad Pros and 120 € for the iPad Air 2.

iPads don't need a full-body case my opinion. If you put them separate from other stuff in a bag within a separate compartment it should be fine. The iPad Pro’s screen is sufficiently protected by the Smart Keyboard, which also doubles as a stand. And the MacBook’s screen is protected when the lid is closed and it brings its own stand. The screen of the iPad Air 2 is a little bit protected with the magnetically attached Ultrathin keyboard, but it comes off easily. And it needs a stand. So I use a Smart Cover for protection and as a stand and take it off when I use the keyboard. The Logitech Keys-To-Go fabric keyboard weighs 195 g including charging cable vs. 315 g for the Ultrathin. You can save 120 g while having a detached keyboard.

## Conclusion

The 12.9″ iPad Pro is a little heavier than the MacBook 12″ (6 % with keyboard, power adapter and cable) and about as expensive (the MacBook being 12 % more expensive). The 2016 MacBook 12″ is a little faster than the 12.9″ iPad Pro. So you only save a little money and get a device having about the same performance, which is much more limited than an ordinary notebook. If you add an Apple Pencil for 109 € and the cellular option for 150 € you end up paying 1560 €, which is a little more than the MacBook, but you get Internet almost everywhere and using the Pencil feels like magic. It makes it a whole different device. For the record, the [Logitech Create iPad Pro Keyboard](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/create-ipad-pro-keyboard) costs 150 €, doubles as a case but weighs 725 g, which is more than the 12.9″ iPad Pro itself. It feels cheap and the iPad is hard to remove from the case, which I do regularly. I like the iPad to feel like a tablet and not a notebook.
