I'm not obsessive but I keep things I want to consume or work on around for way too long. If I remove one item, two items get added. The pile is constantly growing. And it drowns my energy.

I have the habit of reading the easy things first and postpone the harder things. It’s feels easier to focus on the quick wins and reduce the influx by checking them off. Rather read news than work on project. Because I work in digital media
