* Have to have “blog” or another moniker in the URL
* Blog posts don’t have a trailing slash in the URL
* Awkward editor for creating blog posts
* Settings are nested deeply
* Everything feels slow
* Images don’t have the domain name in the URL but Squarespace’s domain name
* Category don’t have proper URLs but are searches and therefore ugly ?category=[categoryname]

## I Like

* Source links at the end of posts
* Linked post titles (remove source link at the end of post)
* Hierarchical comments are distinguished on mobile by • (dots)
* Comment time update via AJAX for every comment
* Thumbnail view if images are added to posts
* Locations for posts
