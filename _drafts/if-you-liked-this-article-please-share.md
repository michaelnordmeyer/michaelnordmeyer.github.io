Help from all of you
To my loyal Zen Habits readers:

As I settle into Zen Habits’ new home, I’m tweaking new features and fixing links and bugs. A couple ways you can help me:

* Bookmark it: I think the move to a different domain caused a number of people to be confused or lost … I could use help from all of you in guiding new readers to this site. If you like the site, please give the main page a thumbs up in Stumbleupon, or bookmark it in Delicious. That would help send people to the new site, as those going to pages in the old site seem to be getting lost.
* Gimme feedback: I’m still fixing old links, and will be for a few more days, but if you spot any other problems, please let me know. Also, I’d appreciate feedback on some new features:
    * Top commenters: This new feature, in the sidebar, is meant to recognize the valuable contributions of all the readers who leave comments. First of all, the stats for this are just being accumulated, starting now. So it doesn’t include all the old comments. The all-time top commenters are actually Kamal and Stayfly. Second, this feature doesn’t seem to be working on the home page. Trying to figure out why.
    * Popularity: Each post has a popularity rating at the bottom. The most popular post is rated 100%, while all others are rated a percentage of this top post. Also, the most popular posts are listed in the sidebar, and if you’re looking at a Category page, it’ll have the most popular posts in that category. Again, it just started collecting stats, so old posts won’t rank well. This’ll even out over time.

Thank you all for your continued support and patience. You make this site what it is. -Leo
