Pro:

* Lots of interest and interaction is probably a signal of importance for Google

Cons:

* Comments destroy the keyword density

If you get a good comment, got to the commenter’s blog and comment over there

## New wine in an old bottle

If a post on your blog becomes incredibly popular and starts to rank for a nice keyword, like mine did for WordPress SEO, you could do the following:

* create a new page with updated and improved content
* change the slug of the old post to post-name-original
* publish the new page under the old post’s URL, or redirect the old post’s URL to the new URL
* send an e-mail to everyone who linked to your old post that you’ve updated and * improved on your old post
* wait for the links to come in, again;
* rank even higher for your desired term as you’ve now got:
    * more control over the keyword density
    * even more links pointing at the article
    * the ability to keep updating the article as you see fit to improve on it’s content and ranking

Some among you will say: I could have 301 redirected the old post to the new one with the same effect. True. Except: you’d lose the comments on the old post, which is in my opinion a sign of disrespect to people who took the time to comment, and 301 redirects take quite a bit of time sometimes. Of course you should treat this technique with care, and not abuse it to rank other products, but I think it can be done in everyone’s benefit.

## Find related blogs, and work them

If you want to rank for certain keywords, go into [Google Blogsearch](https://www.google.com/blogsearch), and see which blogs rank in the top 10 for those keywords. Read those blogs, start posting insightful comments, follow up on their posts by doing a post on your own blog and link back to them: communicate! The only way to get the links you’ll need to rank is to be a part of the community.
