## Pro

* Songs start very fast
* Pause/Play works immediately without any lag
* No drainage of phone battery

## Cons

* No play controls on lock screen
* Play controls in control center work and display song, but don't show elapsed time (always 0:00)
* After playing maybe 15-20 songs, even the displayed song was wrong. But it also was wrong in the Spotify iOS app, which I opened to verify the song. It took 5–10 seconds to update.

What I don't know is at what quality the music is streamed to my A9. Guessing from the normal settings it’s either 192 Kbit/s or 320 Kbit/s. I would prefer the first as a blind test wouldn't show any difference in sound quality.
