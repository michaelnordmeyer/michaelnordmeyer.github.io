- Symlinking files into iTunes music library
  - *Delete from library* only deletes from view, not from drive
- Adding to library will immediately upload the added files to iCloud
- Adding to a player on iOS like Infuse will result in doubled files: one for the download via iCloud, one for the copy to the app via share sheet. This may be a problem for limited space on the devide and large files. A 10 GB video needs 20 GB of free space to get it into the player.
