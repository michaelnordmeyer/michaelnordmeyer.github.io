* You have to use a US address
* You have to use a US phone number. Even after creating an account you cannot change to a non-US number.
* The number has to be in an US format (123) 456 7890:
  * (123): Area code, also for mobile
  * 456 7890: The number
* Two-factor authentication won’t be able to send you a SMS/Text to unlock your account because of the US number (if you don’t manage to get a working one). Your only chance to unlock your account if you forgot your password is to use the recovery code.

Logging out of iTunes Store turns off iTunes Match. Turning it on again is a two-step process: First the login to your iTunes account and then turning on iTunes Match again. It’s not only inconvenient, it also means your song catalog (not the songs itself) and the covers have to be downloaded again. Especially the covers take a long time and you might have to scrub through your library to initiate the download for every song or album which is displayed.
