The most computing-related maintenance work I have nowadays is maintaining my mobile devices and their sync and cloud status. I have an iPhone 6 64 GB, an iPad Air 2 128 GB and a MacBook Retina 12" 512 GB.

On my Mac everything just works. All my data is on my Mac, even though I sync to iCloud and DropBox. Everything is conveniently accessible. I'm not limited in any way. I have an automatic backup for my Mac using my Time Capsule. Every hour the Mac is backed up automatically via WLAN. If the Mac’s hardware fails, I just reinstall from the Time Capsule and get all my data and settings back. No additional work necessary.

Not so much on my iPhone and iPad. I can't get everything an these devices, because Apple decided that your data is stored within their respective apps (it’s siloed). I have to sync with either my MacBook or use cloud services. This should be seamless. But here’s the rub: you have to get your data manually, it’s very slow and the data lives in different places which makes it hard to use.

While having all your Numbers files within Numbers seems convenient, it also means you can't manage your files my topic. E.g. having all the files which belong to a certain project in a single place. Numbers files are in Numbers, Keynote files are in Keynote. If you have several files of the same type for the respective projects, you have to create a project folder in several places.

While this seems doable albeit inconvenient it’s not feasible for files, wich don't belong to a single application like .txt files. You can argue that those files shouldn't be files but stored in an app like Notes or Evernote
