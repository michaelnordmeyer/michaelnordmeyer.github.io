Tumblr has been a success. It’s easy to use and free. Many non-technical people prefer it over hosting their own WordPress. But even free hosted WordPress on WordPress.com is too complicated. So Wordpress has to be supercharged.

## Jetpack

[Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/) is a plugin which adds important and convenient features to WordPress. The important features like sitemaps and better search engine compatibility should be built into WordPress, but Matt Mullenweg, the founder of WordPress, disagrees and keeps those separate. Essentially Jetpack is a way to get people onto WordPress.com. [It’s a business case](http://scratch99.com/wordpress/opinion/jetpack-business-case-for-bloat/). To use Jetpack you need to have a WordPress.com account. The self-hosted blog has to be connected to WordPress.com. While for some features [this is the only way to do it](https://www.wphub.com/blog/posts/mullenweg-responds-jetpacks-foibles/), other features could be added to WordPress without a connection. Especially _those_ features should be built into Wordpress.

## A Reading Feed like Tumblr

WordPress apps for desktop (Windows and macOS) and mobile (iOS and Android) only work if Jetpack is installed. That’s uncool. The part of Jetpack which enables access for those apps is not user-facing and should be baked into WordPress. All apps default to the WordPress.com reading feed. This is the source of Tumblr’s success. So WordPress.com copied it to achieve the same user engagement. Unfortunately not every user needs to have this feed as blogs can easily be aggregated using a feed reader and read in a convenient manner.
