LINK TO DATA USAGE POST

I feel the days of wired Internet are over. And by wired Internet I also mean a wire which comes into your home. It’s time for LTE-only. One contract, one plan for all your devices.

You need multiple SIMs for that, if you have multiple devices. Notebooks and desktops don’t have cellular hardware. These have to connect to either a smartphone or tablet with cellular hardware running a wireless hotspot or a dedicated LTE router.

But there’s a trend for average people to not buy computers anymore. Why should they if they have a perfectly fine smartphone or tablet? Especially for young people it seems more reasonable to buy and expensive smartphone and use the saved money from not buying a computer. Or buying a comparatively inexpensive tablet when compared to a notebook of the same quality.

The money which has been saved by cancelling DSL, cable or satellite can be used to get a better LTE plan. And over time the plans for LTE will be much cheaper and have more data included while the flat-rate plans of wired Internet can’t get much cheaper. [AT&T is testing 5G in 2016](https://about.att.com/story/unveils_5g_roadmap_including_trials.html), which is supposed to be 10–100 times faster than 4G LTE.

## What About Wi-Fi?

You don’t get away without Wi-Fi, even if the data on your plan is large enough. Mobile devices restrict heavy data usage on mobile Internet connections. iOS restricts app downloads to 100 MB per app on cellular. iCloud backup and iCloud photo library only work on Wi-Fi. AirPlay needs Wi-Fi to play songs from the computer, iPhone or iPad. And last but not least the Apple TV needs Wi-Fi, if the videos are played back on a computer, because the video is not from the iTunes store.

The solution is to get a Mi-Fi or a full-grown LTE-Wi-Fi router, which use 4G/LTE as the connection to the Internet.

## What About Families?

Yeah, families makes it a little harder. But then again, every family member wants to have a mobile data allowance.

## What If I Live in a Place Where I don’t Get LTE/4G?

Well, that’s unfortunate. You can only choose between the options you have available.

## The Big Stepping Stone: Video

Video uses a lot of data. It’s the arch-enemy of mobile data. But over time, they will become friends. If you [cut the cord](https://michaelnordmeyer.com/cord-cutting-just-do-it) you can’t watch as much video as you might would have otherwise. A flat-rate and an infinite amount of movies, TV shows and YouTube videos on the Internet can lead to a couch potato habit. There’s always a video after a click or tap which detracts you from live.

Personally I cut down on Internet video, because it took way too much time in my life and distracted me. But I’m still bullish on YouTube. I think will be one of the top three places where people will spend their media and therefore spare time.
