Because of my [30 day challenge](https://michaelnordmeyer.com/30-day-challenge-no-social-media-no-online-video) I was absent from Social Media and parts of the Internet. For some reason I used Notes on iOS and macOS to write tweets. Like to scratch an itch. It felt different, but good. So now I'm posting all these “ iPad Pro is a little heavier than the MacBook 12" (6 % with keyboard, power adapter and cable) and about as expensive (the MacBook being 12 % more expensive). The 2016 MacBook 12" is a little faster than the 12.9" iPad Pro. So you only save a little money and get a device having about the same performance, which is much more limited than an ordinary notebook. If you add an Apple Pencil for 109 € and the cellular option for 150 € you end up paying 1560 €, which is a little more than the MacBook, but you get Internet almost everywhere and using the Pencil feels like magic. It makes it a whole different device. For the record, the [Logitech Create iPad Pro Keyboard](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/create-ipad-pro-keyboard) costs 150 €, doubles as a case but weighs 725 g, which is more than the 12.9” in this post, because it seems the right thing to do.

It reminds me of when I was posting to my now deleted Tumblr to cross-post on Twitter and Facebook afterwards. Most of the posts have been imported into this blog.
