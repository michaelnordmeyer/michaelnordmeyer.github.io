Today emails are more of a conversation than a letter. That’s why it’s not a good idea to treat each email separately. Instead a conversational timeline like messaging apps use is more appropriate. To all email haters: Face it, you need to have some sort of identification handle and you need some way to digitally communicate with people you don’t have any sort of relationship before starting to communicate.

## The Identification Handle

The identification handle is needed to identify yourself to create accounts for services. The most universal ones are phone numbers and email addresses.

## Communication with Unknown People

For this some sort of communication ID—your identification handle—needs to be public. And any public communication IDs can be spammed. Spam seems to be unavoidable. Some people will always spam, one way or the other. But spam filters are pretty good. Only closed ecosystems like Facebook or WhatsApp can speedily shut down spammers. But closed eco systems have a major drawback: if you are inclined to leave this system your digital identity ceases to exist. To achieve all the following ideas email clients have to change their behaviour. But apart from changing how the emails are displayed the changes needed already exist today and just have to be properly applied.

1.  **Always attach a vcard**. This would remove the need for long signatures. All your contact data is stored in the vcard and legalese could be saved in a field called “legal”. Email clients can display this information inline automatically if needed.
2.  **Sort emails by sender and recipients**. These can be called conversations and would help to mentally process large amounts of email better.
3.  **Have a hidden newsletter and notification files in the email header for non-human interaction**. Like x-newsletter and x-notification. Email clients would be able to sort those automatically without the need to create rules.

## Sort emails by sender and recipients

Most communication is more of a discussion or chat, or Especially there’s no “Sent” anymore. Only one stream per conversation. That means there’s no need to add the previous email to the reply, because it’s displayed right next to the answer. All attachments sent by people taking part in this particular conversation can be easily accessed in an attachment view: documents, photos, videos, … You could get rid of “Re:” and “Fwd:”. There is no “Re:”, because conversations are not sorted by subject. And instead of forwarding single messages you can just add a person to a conversation and all messages can be sent in bulk.

## Have a hidden newsletter and notification files in the email header for non-human interaction

All non-human email conversation boils down to two types of emails: newsletters and notifications. Newsletters are a way to stay in touch in a non-personal way and offer some information for people who are interested in this information. Notifications is everything else. Social network notifications, information about service changes, shipping details, etc.

## Too Many Emails

Too many emails just means too much communication. The same is true for all other means of communication. A messaging system or slack is also a burden, if more communication is taking place than you have time or attention for.

## Solutions

There’s a macOS and iOS app called [Unibox](https://www.uniboxapp.com/), which has been around for quite some time but apparently didn't gain much traction. Most users complain about crashes. They have an macOS trial version on their website and the [iOS app for iPhone and iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/app/unibox/id933879046?mt=8) is free with in-app-purchases.
