You can create two kinds of iOS backups:

1.  A local backup on your computer using iTunes
2.  A remote backup in iCloud

But these backups don’t have the same kind of data. My iCloud iPhone backup is about 0.8 GB in size while the iTunes backup is 1.7 GB. If [iCloud Photo Library](https://michaelnordmeyer.com/icloud-photo-library-photos) is not used, the camera roll is also locally backed-up to iTunes. Almost everything not stored in iCloud.

* Mail
* Kindle
* Audible
* Evernote
* Our Choice by Al Gore (huge downlad, 1 GB)
* RSS feed reader like Reeder, Feedly
* Read Later apps like Pocket and Instapaper
* Newsstand publications
* In-app magazines and newspapers
* Spotify offline music
* Yelp bookmarks

Also watch out for your photo apps which you bought on the AppStore. Some of them don’t automatically store the pictures in the camera roll but somewhere else. And this is most often not backed up by iTunes or iCloud backup.
