You have four different logins: iTunes Store, macOS App Store, iBooks Store and iCloud. All of these logins will work with the same Apple ID, but you could also use different Apple IDs if you have the need for it. You can use all four on a Mac.

On iOS you have three stores (no macOS App Store obviously), but only two logins: iCloud and iTunes Store.
