Ads by e.g. “The Deck” cannot be blocked, because some iOS app developers deliberately allow them (e.g. 1Blocker). That’s wrong and a misguided choice by the developers. It’s the user’s choice what kind of apps are acceptable, not the developer’s. Even though The Deck’s ads don't track users and are not intrusive.

For these kind of choices an “acceptable ads” whitelist setting, which is pre-populated with those ad networks and is turned on by default, is a reasonable alternative.

The content blocker and ad blocker business is a messy one, because developers charge money for an app which makes it impossible for others to make money. The developers get paid for their work, the ad-supported content producers don't. If it’s a question a ethics, then developers shouldn't charge money for blocking money-making ads.
