Because of my [30 day challenge](/30-day-challenge-no-social-media-no-online-video) I was absent from Social Media and parts of the Internet. For some reason I used Notes on iOS and macOS to write tweets. Like to scratch an itch. It felt different, but good. So now I’m posting all these “tweets” in this post, because it seems the right thing to do.

It reminds me of when I was posting to my now deleted Tumblr to cross-post on Twitter and Facebook afterwards. Most of the posts have been imported into this blog.
