[Hello](https://hello.is) started a very successful [Kickstarter campaign for Sense](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hello/sense-know-more-sleep-better) in July of 2014. It went viral and got a lot of positive press and feedback. One month later, they successfully raised $2,410,741 USD from 19,349 backers on August 22nd, 2014. My credit card was charged on the same day.

I chose to get the cotton-colored version instead of the charcoal one with an extra sleeping pill for a total of $129, or $144 including international shipment. They estimated to ship in November of 2014.

Hello [released the Sense for non-kickstarter users in March](https://blog.hello.is/post/111952039408/sense-launches-today), even though many backers didn't receive their Senses (hah!), especially international backers like me. I got mine end of June, 2015. That’s a whole seven month late.

Unfortunately the fulfillment company made a mistake with the accompanied customs papers. I had to pay import sales tax on delivery to UPS (about $37/€33), which I begrudgingly did. I was happy to get hold of my Sense, but was sure I wasn't supposed to pay the tax. But kudos to Hello: They contacted me on their behalf the next day and told me that I can either get the money back if I already paid and received the shipment or wanted me to refuse delivery.
