## Who

I'm Michael Nordmeyer, a freelance software and web developer, project manager and consultant from [Hamburg, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburg). I develop concepts, strategies and applications for web and mobile while working for major corporations, digital agencies and small startups.

## What

I strongly prefer agile and lean methodologies and use Scrum and Kanban in my projects. Currently these are my technologies of choice if I do the actual coding: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3. Detailed profiles are on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelnordmeyer) or [XING](https://www.xing.com/profile/Michael_Nordmeyer). If you choose to contact me on LinkedIn or XING, please introduce yourself in a meaningful manner and state your business. I get way too many connection requests without telling me about the nature of the request.
