A friend of mine ([@moeffju](https://twitter.com/moeffju "@moeffju on Twitter")) [quit Twitter recently](https://moeffju.net/blog/twitter-breakup/ "quit Twitter recently"). I think this is not unreasonable if you think about how Twitter wants to change itself to monetize better. Because every move they make is making Twitter worse for most of the heavier users. I’m sympathetic to his move although his reasons where different.

But I also noticed that in international technology circles many people use their Twitter username as the _only_ digitally means of identification or connection.

I’ve been to the [European Ruby Camp](http://2014.eurucamp.org/ "European Ruby Camp") (eurucamp) three weeks ago. Most attendees predominently referred to themselves either on their name tag or on the eurucamp website using their Twitter nick.

Some “hip” websites having their focus on user communication like messaging or some form of feed also only use the Twitter username (I cannot remember the sites off the top of my head).

I also used a couple of iOS apps–which are not Twitter apps–where usernames starting with an @ are automatically linked to Twitter.

## Am I Also Quitting Twitter?

So my feeling of leaving Twitter is like I’m going to isolate myself. Because the most compelling reason of using Twitter is that you can follow people and/or communicating  with them directly without asking for email addresses or friendship requests first. A very loose and open network of people.

It’s also easy to find “followers”. Not the Twitter vanity number, but people who want to support your cause and/or work with you on some projects.

As long as I don’t find another way of getting the same from another service I most likely won’t leave.
