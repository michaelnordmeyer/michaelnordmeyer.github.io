Tomorrow I’m attending [Google Chrome Extensions Hackathon](https://sites.google.com/site/gchromeevent/home) in Hamburg. [Martin Thielecke](https://www.mthie.com/) (post in German) told me today at [Web Monday Hamburg](http://www.webmontag-hamburg.de/) (post in German) at [Gloria](https://www.yelp.com/biz/gloria-hamburg-2) about it. Oh my, there are way too many events out there.

“Google Chrome Extensions Event & Hackathon Roadshow” is touring Germany and having three official events in Hamburg, Düsseldorf and Munich, while there are a couple of unofficial ones organized by local [GTUGs](https://developers.google.com/groups/directory/). GTUGs are [“Google Technology User Groups”](https://developers.google.com/groups/directory/), of which there are 10 in Germany.

This [hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) will beheld during a GTUG battle, where you can win a lot of Google swag like a couple of Nexus Ones, notebook sleeves and backpacks.

The goal of these hackathons is the release of finished software which was built at the hackathon in a timely manner. In this case it’s [Chrome Extensions](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions) to get developers up to speed and lure them away from [Mozilla’s Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), which has many plugins.

Tomorrow’s topic is [“browser actions”](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browserAction) and [“page actions”](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/pageAction), as Google this technology. The battle will end on 2010-03-14. All extensions have to be submitted at this point to get considered for the drawing.

I’m curios if we can manage to pull off some cool stuff.
