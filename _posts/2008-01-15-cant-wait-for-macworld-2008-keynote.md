I’m eagerly awaiting the MacWorld keynote on Tuesday. I tend to skip most of the rumors nowadays, because I do not gain anything from them anymore.

Either the rumors are vage and incomplete and therefore just useless, or the rumors are valid and cover all the details, which _seriously_ spoil the fun watching the keynote. I’ll never forgive me for having a peak at the Canadian Time magazine cover the day before the keynote in (wait a sec, hmm…) 2002 to get a first glimpse at the new iMac (flat panel, Luxo).

Even if you are not an Apple fan or don’t plan on buying new stuff, a Steve Jobs keynote is always fun and enlighting. If you have ever been bored to death by some cheesy PowerPoint slide show displayed by an even more boring presenter, _please_, do yourself a favor and watch Steve Jobs giving a keynote.

_OK, so what would I like to have on tuesday evening?_
  
Of course a new notebook.

_What kind of notebook?_
  
Hm, still can’t make up my mind. Either a fancy new MacBook Pro or an ultra-light MacBook with 3G mobile wireless built in.

An ultra-light would be cool but I think I will miss my internal optical drive. And for proper work I need more pixels on screen than an ultra-light will provide.

Unfortunately I tend to be always on(line). An iPhone is cool, but still somewhat limited. I have to decide until after the keynote. First come, first serve. Grr.
