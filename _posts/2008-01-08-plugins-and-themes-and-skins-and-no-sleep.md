Toying around with this blog is fun. At least sometimes. I mean – err – at the beginning.

Some people did some great stuff for WordPress which I appreciate very much. But after trying out some new themes and plugins, I need more plugins for the new themes and new themes which support those shiny new plugins.

After switching themes, which support different plugins (like Hemmingway and K2), some stuff will break. Like archives in Hemmingway.

Getting all up and running felt like a trial and error server configuration. I stumble around, fiddle with some settings, get annoyed by Unix permissions, and forget all about time. At least skins are working fine.

So many hours passed and I’m really worn out.

Time to sleep – what’s left of the night until morning.
