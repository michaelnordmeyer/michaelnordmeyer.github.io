I deleted most of my posts written in German, because I decided to write exclusively in English again.

## Why?

I switched to German in mid-2008 because my audience at the time was mostly German. Writing posts in your native language is much easier and faster as well. Especially if you write about German topics, which is very likely if you live in this country. It seems awkward to write in English about strictly German topics for a mostly German audience.

Nowadays Iâ€™m less interested in German topics so it makes much more sense to address a much larger audience which also includes English-speaking Germans.

## And Why Did I Delete the Posts?

Having German articles scattered between English ones is not very user-friendly. They come up in related posts, archives and feeds. So I translated the important ones which even today still have value for readers. The others are gone for good.
