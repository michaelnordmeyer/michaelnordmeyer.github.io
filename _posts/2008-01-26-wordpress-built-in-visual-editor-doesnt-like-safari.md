Re-opening a written post using WordPress’ built-in visual editor will remove most of the styles I was using in this post. Especially paragraphs and line breaks. On load I briefly see the underlying code having paragraphs but once the “visualness” kicks in all those styles are gone. Grrr.

I was under the impression that Safari 3 is now a first class citizen regarding JavaScript-powered web pages. But maybe the visual editor wasn’t tested thoroughly for Safari 3. What a pity.
