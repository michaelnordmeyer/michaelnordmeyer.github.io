The [OnePlus 2](https://oneplus.net/2) has been released. OnePlus is quite popular among Android enthusiasts, because they build high-end phones at very competitive prices. The phones cost about 2/3 of the price of a comparable Samsung, Sony or HTC.

## Specs

The OnePlus 2 comes in two models:

  * 16 GB storage and 3 GB RAM for $329/€339
  * 64 GB storage and 4 GB RAM for $389/€399

They sport a 64 bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 Octacore CPU running at 1.8 GHz, an Adreno 430 GPU, a 13 megapixel camera, a 5.5 inch Full HD IPS display with 1920×1080 pixel and a 3,300 mAh battery. They also have a fingerprint sensor and a Dual SIM slot.

Unfortunately the OnePlus 2 can only be purchased if you have an invite. These invites are only available on special occasions or promotions from OnePlus or from former buyers.

## Dual SIM Slot

A Dual SIM slot is very handy if you use a second data plan at home or are traveling abroad and get a much cheaper local plan with a sufficient data allowance.

By using both SIMS at the same time you can use the Internet at reasonable prices but still be available under your normal phone number. You can also receive texts on WhatsApp et.al., which is tied to your home phone number and only works if this number is available to your phone by keeping your home SIM card active.

## Available Storage

The OnePlus 2 64 GB model has effectively 54 GB of storage available. The rest is used by the [OxygenOS 2.0](https://oneplus.net/2/oxygenos). The OnePlus 2 16 GB model has 11.6 GB of storage free.

While 11.6 GB is enough for the common set of applications most users will install, it won’t be if many large games, music or photos and videos are stored. So if you want to make use of the excellent 13 megapixel camera of the OnePlus 2 do yourself a favor and get the 64 GB version.

Music is not a problem anymore if you have a music subscription with Spotify, Google Play Music et.al., but you might be restricted to using wireless to listen to music or having a huge data plan. Streaming music at 128 Kbit/s will get you 56 MB of data usage in an hour, 256 Kbit/s accordingly 112 MB.

## Replaceable Back Covers

The back cover of the OnePlus 2 is easily replaceable. OnePlus offers four different additional covers, three of them are made from wood: Bamboo, Black Apricot, Rosewood and Kevlar.

Each cover costs $26.99/€29.99 and is available in the [OnePlus store](https://oneplus.net/oneplus-2).

## OxygenOS 2.0

[OxygenOS 2.0](https://oneplus.net/2/oxygenos) is an Android operating system developed by OnePlus. It’s based on Google’s stock Android 5.1.1 Lollipop and only has minor modifications. This allows for getting updates to the phone much faster than the heavily modified versions Samsung ships.
