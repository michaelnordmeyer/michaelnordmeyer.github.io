Mobile operating systems are growing and install more apps by default. I was wondering how much space is left on my iPhone after a fresh install.

I use 64 GB models since I bought an iPhone 4S in 2011, because my 32 GB iPhone 4 got very full. I was just under 32 GB but iOS updates could be a problem (they need a couple of gigabytes to install over the air).

Long story short: about 55 GB of 64 GB are free. 30 apps are installed by default.

The same applies to iPads and iPod Touchâ€™.
