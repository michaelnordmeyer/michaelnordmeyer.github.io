The [next08](https://nextconf.eu/) conference has passed. For me it was a crowded day meeting many of my fellow friends at the conference for having great conversations. Some sessions were also extremely inspiring, some were just ordinary. It’s always hard to achieve a balance for attendees with different backgrounds and interests.

As far as I know there are no video streams. Kinda disappointing. A couple of blog posts covering the sessions written by “live blogger” hired for this are on [fischmarkt](http://fischmarkt.de/). Most are in German.

Many thanks to [SinnerSchrader](https://sinnerschrader.com/) for hosting the conference.

BTW, The event team was just fabulous. I _never_ had service people at a conference doing such a great job. They were very forthcoming, always polite and professional.

And the party was a blast. Yeah!
