It’s the first year that [next conference](https://nextconf.eu/) is taking place in Berlin at [Station Berlin](http://www.station-berlin.de/). The people of Hamburg, were the conference was taking place the years before, weren’t happy about that, because SinnerSchrader has it’s headquarters in Hamburg and the city is also famous for it’s strong media and publishing businesses. Hamburg is _the_ media capital of Germany.

Of all the talks I listened to Ola Ahlvarsson’s “Inside the Head of an Entrepreneur” was the best by far. His main point:

Ahlvarsson described thinking and working habits of serial entrepreneurs:

[Dennis Crowley](http://denniscrowley.com/), co-founder of location service [FourSquare](https://foursquare.com/) ~~is speaking tomorrow~~ (he has pneumonia and won’t come), and media strategist [Brian Solis](http://www.briansolis.com/) will give a talk to which I’m looking forward to.

A very unconventional but highly recommended talk is [Itay Talgam](http://www.talgam.com/), an israelian conductor, who is very successful using his “maestro program” to foster team building in enterprise companies. He talked about “Culture Changers: Great Conductors’ Art of Rehearsing”:
