I’m attending [DNAdigital](https://web.archive.org/web/20160401152900/http://www.dnadigital.de/) (post in German) [Open Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space) preparation day today.

This preparation day is meant to be kind of a trial or rehearsal for the final Open Space on 2008-11-03, where selected “digital natives” talk to selected CXOs to give these a chance to experience firsthand how young people think about technology.

This new technology feels natively for young people, but hasn’t got a hold in larger companies or enterprises. Without proper use of technology those potential employers are not very attractive for the younger generation.

At the same time CXOs are able to explain to digital natives what kind of challenges they face while trying to modernize their companies and to promote their efforts to get digital natives to join their companies.

This is not to be mistaken for a career day of some sort but more of a way of bridging the gap between older and younger folks with respect of cutting edge digital technology to create a paradigm shift.

The days results are going to be in the [DNAdigital Wiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20160401151700/http://www.dnadigital.de/networks/wiki/index.wiki) (post in German), while the discussions will be streamed live.

Also [David Weinberger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Weinberger), co-author of the [Cluetrain Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluetrain_Manifesto), will be giving a live video interview.
