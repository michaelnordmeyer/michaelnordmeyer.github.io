JavaScript blocklists block intrusive JavaScript from sites which display ads like double underlined keywords showing popups or display a notification of some sort to lure you into reading more articles to generate more page views. Those notifications slide in from the lower right.

If you use those blocklists the website will continue to work and look the same minus the intrusive behavior.

I use plugins for Chrome [Chrome JavaScript blacklist by Jiayong Ou](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/javascript-blacklist/emcepjkdiiaenmoaghcfghjjppbkbhnf) and Safari [Safari JSBlacklist by Drew Thaler](https://code.google.com/p/jsblacklist/downloads/list) to add those blocklists to my browser. This is my blocklist:

    intellitxt.com,
    serving-sys.com,
    cdn.taboolasyndication.com,
    adgardener.com,
    getconnected.southwestwi-fi.com

Just copy and paste this list into the text field of the respective plugin and you are all set.

If you have some block-worthy scripts to share please [tell me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/mnordmeyer).
