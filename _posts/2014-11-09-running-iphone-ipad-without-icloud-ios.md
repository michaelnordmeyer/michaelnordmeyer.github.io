It’s possible, but not feasible anymore.

Some people don’t like to store their personal data in the cloud for a variety of reasons. Unlike Google’s Android which uses Google services a lot from the start, Apple users got away with this until now.

One of the reasons is with OS X 10.9 Mavericks Apple removed the ability to locally sync your address book, bookmarks, calendar and email accounts. Now you have to use iCloud for this. The _Info_ tab on the device sync screen is gone and Apple refers to iCloud for syncing this kind of data.

Obviously it’s more convenient and the syncing happens immediately and automatically. Every time. Without having to be on the same Wi-Fi network with your other devices. This is reason enough for Apple to get rid of the redundant old stuff.
