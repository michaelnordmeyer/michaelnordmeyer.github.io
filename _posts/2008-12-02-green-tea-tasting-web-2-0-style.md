If finished my first tea tasting in my kitchen and it was fun.

While attending community camp Berlin in November I registered for tea tasting at [Pure Tea](https://www.puretea.de/index.php) (post in German). Andreas, one of the Pure Tea guys, is traveling to about every BarCamp in Germany to brew tea for the participants. I’d like to thank him for his effort.

Pure Tea is an online tea company from [Lüneburg, Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lueneburg), which only sells organic teas. They promote their teas on their blog, Twitter and Facebook and let users vote on their teas.

The names of the teas are on the packaging. This will inevitably lead to a preselection. Who wants to drink “Cui Feng” or “Xiang Cha” if you can drink “Green Monkey” or “Snow Buds”?

## Tasting

The test process is easy. You have to assign marks for four different areas:

  1. The dry leaves: visual and smell
  2. The wet leaves after brewing: volume and smell
  3. The stepp in the cup: luminosity, color, smell and taste
  4. The verdict: put it on sale or not?

You need a little bit of practice to infuse and steep four teas at the same time if you don’t have enough tea strainers. These green teas should only steep for two minutes which makes it quite hard to do it in time.

My favorite is “Green Monkey”. Good looks and great taste.

Okay, now I’m going to make an espresso.
