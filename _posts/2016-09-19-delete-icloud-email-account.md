To make things clear I’m not writing about _deleting_ an iCloud email account _from_ an iOS device or Mac, but deleting the whole account altogether. For _removing_ an iCloud email account _from_ a device [look here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201419).

iCloud accounts have often been used as the Apple ID for Apple services like iTunes Store or iOS App Store. Deleting an iCloud account would mean a user couldn’t login anymore and purchased items like movies, TV shows, eBooks and apps wouldn’t be accessible anymore.

Maybe customers losing access to purchased goods is a risk Apple doesn’t want to take, so they disallow deleting an iCloud email account. But there are some options to handle an [iCloud email address](https://michaelnordmeyer.com/icloud-email-address) which may help to circumvent any inconveniences stemming from not being able to delete the account.
