One of the good things about Twitter is that it's like a time capsule. I discover things from ten years back, which I have totally forgotten about, or for which I don't know the details anymore. For posterity I add those to a (neglected) diary I started some years ago.

Even for mundane events this creates a thread of events which retrospectively allow for reflecting and ruminating about my life and what was important to me at the time.

Interestingly I pinpoint event dates to places I worked at the time, even though I don't define myself by my work or the places I worked at. It just gives me a reference, which is mostly visual. I remember by depicting myself at or around the workplace, in space and in time.
