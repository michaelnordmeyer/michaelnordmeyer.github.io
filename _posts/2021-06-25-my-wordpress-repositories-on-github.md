I still have some repositories on Github I have used for customizing my former WordPress installations. I didn't use them in a while because Github Pages still fits my needs better. No hosting, no hassle, and blazingly fast, because the pages are static.

Some changes to update and fix great plugins, which haven't been updated in a while:

- [https://github.com/michaelnordmeyer/memcached-redux](https://github.com/michaelnordmeyer/memcached-redux)
- [https://github.com/michaelnordmeyer/batcache](https://github.com/michaelnordmeyer/batcache)
- [https://github.com/michaelnordmeyer/efficient-related-posts](https://github.com/michaelnordmeyer/efficient-related-posts)

My customized themes having some minor UI changes and a special archive page:

- [https://github.com/michaelnordmeyer/twentysixteen-michaelnordmeyer](https://github.com/michaelnordmeyer/twentysixteen-michaelnordmeyer)

My custom functions which replace a lot of plugins, because once the plugin has been configured, the majority of the plugin code is not needed anymore:
