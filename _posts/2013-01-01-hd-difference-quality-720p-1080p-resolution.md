Many people think only a resolution of 1080p respectively 1080i delivers HD quality. 720p is considered as not good enough. This applies to streaming video at 720p as well. It _has_ to be FullHD. But these people are mistaken.

## Distance to TV

What most people forget is the distance of the viewer to the TV or display.

At a certain distance the eye cannot see a difference between 720p (1280 x 720) and 1080p (1920 x 1080). Single pixels are not visible anymore.

## Optimal Viewing Distance

People having normal eyesight won’t see single pixels on different sized TVs at…

  * 32″ at 1080p: 1,16 m (3.81 ft)
  * 32″ at 720p: 1,70 m (5.58 ft)
  * 42″ at 1080p: 1,63 m (5.35 ft)
  * 42″ at 720p: 2,27 m (7.45 ft)
  * 50″ at 1080p: 1,93 m (6.33 ft)
  * 50″ at 720p: 2,80 m (9.19 ft)
  * 55″ at 1080p: 2,10 m (6.89 ft)

But to achieve good image quality at 720p, the native resolution also has to be about 1280 x 720. 720p content on a 1080p display looks a little bit blurred. And on 4K display it would be even worse.

Whereas 1080p content on a 720p TV looks crisp.

## Conclusion

If you want to save money, buy a TV having a native 720p resolution (HD-ready) and high quality image processing like Panasonic instead of an entry-level FullHD one. Even 1080p content using Bluray or HDTV looks sharp from your couch on one of those devices. **More pixels doesn’t necessarily mean better picture.**
