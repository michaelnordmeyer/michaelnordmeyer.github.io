There are different email addresses you can add to an Apple ID. Here are the different types in a nutshell.

## Primary Email Address

This is the email address for your Apple ID to login and normal communication. Everybody having an Apple ID has a primary address.

## Alternate Email Address

Alternate addresses can help people find you on Apple services. Most people won’t need an alternative address.

## Rescue Email Address

Rescue email addresses are used for accessing your Apple ID when the primary one isn’t working for some reason. This is a security measure and might help you.

## Notification Email Address

This address is only used for notification purposes if you have two-factor authentication enabled and don’t have a rescue email address.

Apple has a [thorough explanation](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201356) in their knowledge base for these different types.
