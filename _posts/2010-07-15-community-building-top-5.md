Charming as ever [EPIC FU](http://epicfu.com/) talks about “community building”. EPIC FU is a web show about geek culture, is cut for very fast pace and covers contemporary topics about lifestyle, geek culture and the internet. It’s made for people in the mid-twenties.

The [current show](http://epicfu.com/show/2010/07/5-ways-to-make-an-awesome-comm.html) is made in a 101 primer style and covers the most important points in less than four minutes:

  * Passion
  * Search
  * Share
  * Engange
  * Create Meaning

I subscribe to these kind of shows via [RSS-Feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) using [Miro](http://www.getmiro.com/), an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) media player for Mac, Linux and Windows. New episodes are downloaded automatically. Because of the convenience and much more interesting topics I don’t watch TV anymore.
