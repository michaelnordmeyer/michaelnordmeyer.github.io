I have a couple of Apple accounts. Some are quite old (mac.com, me.com), some are new (icloud.com). I’d like to merge all these addresses into one account and delete the rest. Unfortunately this is not possible.

**Note: Everything on this page is also applicable to old mac.com or me.com email addresses.**

## Changing an iCloud Email Address

You cannot change an iCloud email address without deleting the Apple account it belongs to, because this email address is the Apple ID for this account.

This means you have to create a new account and transfer all data from the old to the new account.

## Merging an iCloud Email Address

You cannot merge an iCloud email address into another account, because this email address is the Apple ID for this account and can’t be separated.

Even after deleting the Apple account you cannot re-use this email address, because it was already taken (by yourself). Apple doesn’t release email addresses even after a long time like others do.

## Deleting an iCloud Email Address

You cannot delete an iCloud email address without deleting the Apple account it belongs to, because this email address is the Apple ID for this account.

There may be very old accounts (mac.com or me.com), where your Apple ID is your self-chosen username. Then you might have a chance. But if you change the username, you have to use an @iCloud.com email address.

## Changing an iCloud Email Alias

You can delete and recreate an [iCloud email alias](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2622), but you have to use the same account to which the alias belongs to. Between deletion and recreation is a seven-day delay.

## Moving an iCloud Email Alias to a Different Account

Email aliases are forever tied to the account that created them. It cannot later be used to create a new iCloud account or transferred to another account.

## Moving iCloud Data to a New Account

If you want to change accounts you have to move your iCloud data. There are many ways to do this and many places where the data is stored and accessed. So be careful to save and backup everything before you delete your old account.

## Device Limits for Creating iCloud Accounts

Each device can only create three iCloud accounts, after which you can only re-use one of the previously created accounts or create a new one on another iOS device or Mac (OS X Lion or newer).
