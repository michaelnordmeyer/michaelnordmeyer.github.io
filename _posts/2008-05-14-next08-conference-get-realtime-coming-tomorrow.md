I’m really looking forward to attending the [next08](https://nextconf.eu/) conference hosted by [SinnerSchrader](https://sinnerschrader.com/) tomorrow. Although I work at SinnerSchrader right now as a freelancer and know what they’re up to these days, it’s going to be quite an interesting conference.

Some speakers are high profile and a couple of founders are going to present and pitch their products and ideas.

It’s a one day conference with four parallel tracks like keynote and speeches, discussions, presentations and start-ups. It’s about enterprise, marketing, mobile and media.

Now I _just_ have to figure out what I’m going to listen to tomorrow.
