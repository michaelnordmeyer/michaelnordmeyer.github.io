The days go by and I nearly forgot to post my aftermath of the [Google Chrome Extensions Hackathon Hamburg](/google-chrome-extensions-hackathon-hamburg).

After Google giving a short intro to the Chrome extension technology which wasn’t necessary in my opinion, because their are some great tutorial videos on Google’s developer pages, we did some brainstorming what to build. Some people already brought their ideas e.g. porting some Firefox plugins.

There was not much teamwork going on which wasn’t cool but because of the small tasks you have to do for creating extension wasn’t necessary. There are some photos [in Martin Thielecke’s album](https://plus.google.com/photos/113157996690700522471/albums/5441454700611551809).

We have some days left until submission for the contest will be closed. We will meet with some people for a private hackathon to finish the unfinished plugins before submission is closed.

I’m curios how many extensions will be submitted.
