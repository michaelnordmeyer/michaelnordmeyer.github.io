## Who

I'm a freelance software and web developer, project manager and consultant from Hamburg, Germany. I develop concepts, strategies and applications for web and mobile while working for major corporations, digital agencies and small startups.

## What

I strongly prefer agile and lean methodologies and use Scrum and Kanban in my projects. Currently these are my technologies of choice if I do the actual coding: Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3. Detailed profiles are on LinkedIn or XING. You can contact me on any of the following sites. Please introduce yourself in a meaningful manner and state your business. I get way too many connect requests without telling me about the nature of the request.
